GAP-CLoSR-Tools
===============

GAP CLoSR (General Approach to Planning Connectivity from Local Scales to Regional) Tools allows for pre-processing of spatial data for inputs into the Graphab and Circuitscape connectivity modelling software. 

The latest executable version of the GAP CLoSR tool can be downloaded from this repository.

=============================================================

The GAP CLoSR framework, tools and methods was developed by Alex Lechner. Further information can be found in the following publications. 
A tutorial and a list of the latest publications can be found on the following website http://www.nerplandscapes.edu.au/GAP_CLoSR

Outputs of the GAP CLoSR Tool are used in the Graphab and Circuitscape connectivity modelling software: 

Graphab: Foltête J.C., Clauzel C., Vuidel G., 2012. A software tool dedicated to the modelling of landscape networks Environmental Modelling & Software, 38:316-327. http://thema.univ-fcomte.fr/productions/graphab/

The graphical user interface was developed by Michael Lacey in association with Alex Lechner. 

We also wish to acknowledge the contribution of the numerous people who have made this tool possible through their input.
